# machine_learning_challenge

I ran two different classification models. The first one that I ran was Logistical Regression. I got a score of about 0.85. The second one I ran was a SVC and got a score of about .42. I used every column that was not the target as a feature. I did this because I could not determine what the column titles meant from the starter code so I assumed that all columns were credible to include. I believe that the first model is accurate enough to predict plants that could be liveable.
